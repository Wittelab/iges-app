often evocative, their identification on molecular bases remains indispensable in our context for an accurate diagnosis and better management of such areas as genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.
Patients with dystrophinopathies phenotype were seen and enrolled after giving their consent.
Seven families totaling 11 patients with dystrophinopathies phenotype (all male) were enrolled and of the 11 patients, 10 had Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy phenotype and one had Becker Muscular Dystrophy phenotype. The mean age of onset was 4.7 years old.
Our study tends to confirm what is currently found in scientific literature regarding clinical and genetic patterns of dystrophinopathies and our study may be one of the rare studies in sub ‐Saharan Africa treating this subject. It is therefore important that further studies are conducted to better understand the spectrum of these poorly understood diseases.
